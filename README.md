Predict Online Course Completion This project aims to predict whether a learner will complete an online course based on their activity logs. By using various engagement metrics such as login frequency, time spent, quiz attempts, and forum interactions, the model predicts course completion. This can help online learning platforms identify at-risk learners and offer early interventions to improve retention and completion rates.

Project Overview The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a learner will complete an online course based on their behavior and activity logs. By analyzing how learners engage with the course material, the model can classify whether they are likely to complete or drop out of the course.

Use Cases: Educational Platforms: Identify at-risk students and provide targeted support.

Course Designers: Understand which engagement metrics correlate most with course completion.

Data Scientists: Explore predictive modeling and classification for real-world problems in education.

Key Features Data Preprocessing: Cleans and transforms raw learner activity logs into a structured dataset suitable for modeling.

Model Training: Uses machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict course completion.

Evaluation Metrics: Measures model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix heatmaps.

Clustering and Segmentation: Performs unsupervised learning to discover patterns in learner behavior.

Clone the repository:

bash Copy Edit git clone https://github.com/your-username/predict-online-course-completion.git cd predict-online-course-completion Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash Copy Edit python -m venv venv source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate Install dependencies:

bash Copy Edit pip install -r requirements.txt Usage Once you have set up the environment and installed the dependencies, you can run the following scripts to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate performance:

Preprocess Data: Clean and prepare the raw activity logs.

Train Model: Use machine learning algorithms to build a model that predicts course completion.

Evaluate Model: Assess the performance of the trained model using various evaluation metrics.

Clustering: Perform clustering to explore behavior patterns.

Generate Heatmap: Visualize the confusion matrix as a heatmap to better understand model performance.

Evaluation Metrics The model is evaluated using several key metrics:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified instances.

Precision: The proportion of true positives among all predicted positives.

Recall: The proportion of true positives among all actual positives.

F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

ROC-AUC: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, a measure of the model’s discriminatory power.

Confusion Matrix: A visual representation of the true vs. predicted class counts.

Clustering In addition to classification, unsupervised learning methods like KMeans clustering are used to segment learners into different groups based on their activity patterns. This can provide insights into common learner behaviors, such as those most likely to drop out or complete the course.
